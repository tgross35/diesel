<p>This trait is essentially <code>ToSql&lt;Record&lt;ST&gt;&gt;</code> for tuples.
While we can provide a valid body of <code>to_sql</code>,
PostgreSQL doesn’t allow the use of bind parameters for unnamed composite types.
For this reason, we avoid implementing <code>ToSql</code> directly.</p>
<p>This trait can be used by <code>ToSql</code> impls of named composite types.</p>
